.TH XMENU 1
.SH NAME
xmenu \- menu utility for X
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xmenu
.RB [ \-irw ]
.RB [ -p
.IR position ]
.RI [ title ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xmenu
is a menu for X,
it reads a list of newline-separated items from stdin,
shows a menu for the user to select one of the items,
and outputs the item selected to stdout.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP
.B -i
Disable icons.
This makes xmenu loading faster when not using icons.
.TP
.BI -p " position"
Set the position to spawn xmenu.
Without this option, xmenu spawns next to the cursor.
.I position
is a string of the form
.BR INTxINT[:MONITOR] ,
where the first INT is the x position and the second INT is the y position.
The monitor part between brackets is optional.
.B MONITOR
can be a number from 0 to the number of monitors minus 1;
or it can be a string like
.B current
or
.BR cursor .
If present, the monitor specifies that the position is relative to the upper left corner
of that monitor.
If
.B monitor
is
.B current
or
.BR cursor ,
the monitor to be used is that where the cursor is in.
For example,
.B -p 0x0:cursor
specifies that
.B xmenu
must spawn at the position 0x0 of the monitor where the cursor is in.
And
.B -p 100x500:0
specifies that
.B xmenu
must spawn at the position 100x500 of the monitor 0.
.TP
.B -r
If this option is set, the right mouse button is disabled;
so pressing it will not trigger any menu item.
.TP
.B -w
Asks the window manager to draw a border around the menus.
This option may be buggy in some window managers,
specially tiled ones that do not respect window hints.
.PP
Each item read from stdin has the following format:
.IP
.EX
ITEM := [TABS] [[IMAGE TABS] LABEL [TABS OUTPUT]] NEWLINE
.EE
.PP
That means that each item is composed by
tabs, followed by an optional image specification, followed by tabs
followed by a label, followed by more tabs, followed by an output,
and ended by a newline.  Brackets group optional elements.
.IP
The initial tabs indicate the menu hierarchy:
items indented with a tab is shown in a submenu of the preceding item not indented.
An item without initial tabs is a top-level item.
.IP
The image is a string of the form "IMG:/path/to/image.png".
It specifies a image to be shown as icon at the left of the entry.
.IP
The label is the string that will be shown as a item in the menu.
An item without label is considered a separator and is drawn as a thin line in the menu
separating the item above from the item below.
.IP
The output is the string that will be output after selecting the item.
If an item does not have an output, its label is used as its output.
.IP
The newline terminates the item specification.
.PP
If the argument
.I title
is given, the title of the menu window is set to it.
