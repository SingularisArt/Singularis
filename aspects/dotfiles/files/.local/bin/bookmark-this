# ~/.local/share/bookmarks/current and it's up to you to go and clean that file
# out by moving the bookmarks within that file to their respective files within
# the bookmark directory, which is ~/.local/share/bookmarks. Once completed,
# you'll get a notification via dunst saying the link was bookmarked.
